    \nFor this site, I created a WordPress theme with the requested styling, then incorporated a contact form using [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) for it's backend. After that, I configured the other pages so all the owner has to do is create a WordPress post for each gallery, set the gallery's main image as a featured image, and upload to the content section all the images he wants displayed in the gallery's slider, and set the appropriate categories. 
    \nAll galleries of the 'featured' category will show on the home page, whereas galleries with a 'fitness' and/or 'fashion' category will show on the appropriate page.`,

      \nAfter learning Gatsby, I decided to make a new version of this project using what I've since learned in terms of producing more efficient code, and applying the benefits of static site generators. I was also interested in comparing *GTmetrix* and *Lighthouse* results between the site's versions, mainly to see the page speed difference from using *Gatsby Image's* image optimization plugin.`,
